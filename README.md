# WebDriver_TheInternet_Basics
A Quick and Dirty example of a Selenium Test with Dave Haeffer's The-Internet Login page.

This serves as a rough draft of the code in a refactoring example. 

The website can be found on  http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login. 

In src/test/java there is the one class which contains everything:

* SimpleManipulationWebElements

This class will be refactored to show Page Objects, Enums, and Utility classes.
